## Overview

This repository contains an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of a worldwide YouTube channels dataset. The goal is to:

- Understand how creators grow (subscribers, views, uploads)
- Identify category-wise and country-wise behaviour
- Study trends such as channel creation timelines and seasonal upload patterns
- Explore correlations (for example, subscribers vs. views, and population vs. subscriber counts)

The analysis is designed to be reproducible, well-documented, and easy to extend.
